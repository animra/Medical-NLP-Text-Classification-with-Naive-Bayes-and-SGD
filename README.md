# Medical-NLP-Text-Classification-with-Naive-Bayes-and-SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent):
Medical NLP Text Classification with Naive Bayes and SGD is a Python project that showcases the application of machine learning algorithms in the medical NLP domain. It focuses on text classification for categorizing medical documents into relevant classes, utilizing two powerful classifiers: Multinomial Naive Bayes and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The project encompasses essential aspects of text preprocessing, feature engineering, and the incorporation of advanced NLP techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighting and L2 normalization. This project serves as an invaluable resource for NLP enthusiasts and those engaged in medical text analysis. It offers a strong foundation for addressing real-world challenges within healthcare and medical NLP through the effective implementation of text classification
